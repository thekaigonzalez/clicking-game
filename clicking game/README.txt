SUPPORT

| My Game Wont Start! |

5 (Autoclicker speed)
False (has autoclicker)

If any of these are missing, you can add them yourself, or remove them and replace the data needed.

| I Don't see any of the game / Blank GUI |

This is either caused by a compatibility issue, or a code issue, if you have an issue like this,
be sure to tell me by uploading an issue on GitHub.

| Why won't my autoclicker go down to 0? |

The reason your autoclicker wont go down to 0 (AKA instant cash), is because of the hardware limits.

You don't want to have a very slow game experience, and you don't want to be overly powerful. That's where the
autoclicker got it's price.

| Why is the Multiplier machine so expensive? |

Well, the multiplier machine is expensive because you have such a high multiplier. It's a 2x of your
multiple. You can hack your multiplier in the saves.

| An Exception Occurred |
